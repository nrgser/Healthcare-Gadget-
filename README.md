# ü©∫ Healthcare Monitoring Gadget

This project involves the design and implementation of a healthcare monitoring system that collects essential patient vitals through a wearable gadget and displays them in real-time on a web application. The system is intended to help doctors and caregivers remotely monitor patients, especially those with chronic conditions or limited mobility.

## üìå Overview

The healthcare system is composed of two main components:

1. **Embedded Gadget**: A microcontroller-based wearable device that continuously collects biometric data.
2. **Web Application**: An interactive dashboard where medical professionals can access, visualize, and track historical health data.
